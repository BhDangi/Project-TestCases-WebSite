Frontend Setup:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal:


mkdir my-project
cd my-project
Create a file named app.js in the project directory:


touch app.js
Open the app.js file in your preferred code editor and paste the provided frontend code into it.

In your terminal, run the following commands to initialize the project and install the necessary dependencies:

touch app.py
Open the app.py file in your preferred code editor and paste the provided backend code into it.

Install the psycopg2 module to enable Python to connect to the PostgreSQL database:


pip install psycopg2


Running the Application:
Open two separate terminal windows or tabs: one for the frontend and one for the backend.

In the frontend terminal, navigate to the project directory if you're not already in it.

Run the following command to start the React development server:


npm start
In the backend terminal, navigate to the project directory if you're not already in it.

Run the following command to start the Flask server:


python app.py
